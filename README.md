# nonsteam-launchers-shortcut-generator
Project to create links in Steam for all non-steam storefront games that are installed.  Primary target is SteamOS/SteamDeck

This is mainly a personal project, but I imagine that this would be useful for other SD and SteamOS users, so I'm going to try to make it flexible

# Why
Personal experience: Directly installing the non-steam storefronts has proven to be the most reliable way to play non-steam games on SteamOS (Heroic and Lutris frequently have problems installing or launching games, vs the native storefronts which - unless the storefront is broken fundamentally in Proton - always tend to work as expected)

# Research and references
Accumulated research of where various storefronts store data about games they have installed and extracting the necessary data to create a steam shortcut

See https://github.com/sylverpyro/nonsteam-launchers-shortcut-generator/blob/main/non-steam-shortcuts.md

# Tool
The tooling is right now being developed and targed for SteamOS/Steamdeck

Windows users have the luxury of being able to just copy/paste data from the shortcuts from various storefronts to add them to Steam, so automating the addition of shortcuts on Windows will likely be a completely seperate project once this tool reaches 2.0

# Current State
Pre-0.1

Working: Generate text help for creating shortcuts for all installed EGL, GOG, EA, Ubisoft, and Amazon games

Not Working:
- Detection of games that were installed but are now uninstalled is spotty (EA at least is fixed)
  - Does not (currently) advise that a game was uninstalled so the shortcut should be removed (roadmap)
- Battle.net and any other platform not listed in 'working'

Other functionality is listed in Roadmap

# Roadmap
* 0.1
  - Support for main storefronts: EGL, GOG, EA, Ubisoft, Battle.net, Amazon
  - Output accurate data for generating steam links for all installed games

* 0.2
  - Support for detecting proton and GE-Proton instances for generating steam VDF data
  - Support for setting preferred Proton/GE-Proton version (default will likely be Ge-Proton-LATEST, then Proton-LATEST)

* 0.3
  - Support for generating shortcut data that can be manually added to Steam's shortcuts.vdf

* 0.4
  - Detect if a shortcut is already in shortcuts.vdf or not and add if missing

* 0.5
  - Support for other storefronts: itch.io
  - Support for detecting if a game has been uninstalled and remove shortcuts automatically from shortcuts

* 0.6
  - Switchable compatdata folder paths
  - config file support (stores paths compatdata folders)
  - support for compatdata/storefront install folders on sdcard

* 0.7
  - Auto Detect compatdata folders for all storefronts

* 0.8
  - Document how to run via the scripts shortcut in Decky so you can update the game library on the fly
  - Support for re-starting Steam if the shortcuts.vdf file was updated

* 1.0
  - All pre 1.0 features stable

* 1.1
  - Support for bulk updating the Proton version on all shortcuts generated by this tool

* 2.0
  - All pre 2.0 features stable

* 2.1
  - Generate Icon links for shortcuts if game comes with official icon(s)
    - Some stores provide these, some do not

* 2.2
  - Auto-fetch image data from SteamGridDB

* 3.0
  - Create shortcuts for NON-INSTALLED games (i.e. library)
    - Set shortcuts to install & launch the game if selected

## Not on roadmap / may not address
- Support for game-per-compatdata/prefix
  - Both detecting these and generating the proper links likely a nightmare
  - If someone knows even how to generate the links for this (so they use one common instance of the storefront but launch out of individual prefixes let me know - I don't think this would work though)
- Support for Heroic or Lutris installed games
  - Both of these have built-in steam shortcut generation already
- Roms
  - There's tons of great tool for this already (Steam Rom Manager)
- Windows and OSX Support
  - There's not a lot of bulk import tools out there for either platform
  - Very well may some day make a python version that works on Windows
  - This is EXTREMELY low priority and likely will only occur after 2.0
